Heya, after a while I finally decided to release the source code.
I will still give updates, and still give support, but this way the code is a bit more transparent.
This also gives people the chance to help me improve it, or add their own needed additions. :)

I always used this git more of a backup tool than a version control, which I am planning to change.
Keep that in mind.

Also the code is badly commented, as I never thought I was going to release it to the outside.
Over the course of the upcoming releases I will try to improve the comments.

This project is released under the LGPL license.
