Heya, after a while I finally decided to release the source code.
I will still give updates, and still give support, but this way the code is a bit more transparent.
This also gives people the chance to help me improve it, or add their own needed additions. :)


I'd appreciate it if you could pay for the resource if your server makes money.
If you just want to make a server for friends and don't make any money, then I don't want to force you to pay $20 for a plugin.
If that's the case, send me a message or contact me on Skype and we can work something out.
